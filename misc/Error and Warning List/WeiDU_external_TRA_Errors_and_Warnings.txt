It makes sense to have some error and warning messages in different languages.
The corresponding table defines fixed integer values ​​for self-defined errors and warnings.

The reason for this is that the user can be:
* Inexperienced
(Can speak the language but does not have sufficient expertise to understand the content)

* Weak
(Makes a lot of effort, but can't speak the language properly to understand the content)

* Lazy
(Looks superficially at the console and closes it)
